# Overview
This is a simple Go web app that makes calls to a REST API hosted in Heroku.

It is a way for me to learn what Go offers.  

# About the Web App
This web app can run locally, simply execute:

```bash
go run main.go
```
The UI is Boostrap UI, and I will be creating views to display the results of the Cars REST API.
